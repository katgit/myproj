Participants of all fitness levels are invited to attend Seaport Sweat, the city’s largest free workout series, held outdoors at Seaport Common. Now in its eighth season, the program features a variety of new classes and instructors, in addition to award-winning instructors and favorite classes from previous years. These include yoga, pilates, Zumba, barre, athletic conditioning, and boot camp training.

Katia added something here. Tonight at 5:30 pm, join instructor Rob Velasquez for a fast-paced, circuit-style class that combines lower body and core exercises with cardiovascular training. During this class—nicknamed “Peaches Guaranteed”—participants work in groups and move between 6 to 10 stations in a 45-minute period. Velasquez, a former college football coach, is the owner of The Grit Academy Personal Training and cofounder of BackYahd Boston, a local gym and fitness studio. 

Katerina made some changes here At 6:30 pm, meet instructor Britney Willingham for a 45-minute, beginner-friendly pilates fusion session. The class consists of classic and contemporary sequences as well as breathing exercises aimed at strengthening muscles and increasing flexibility. Willingham specializes in teaching pilates, yoga, fitness, and dance.Seaport Sweat doesn’t provide equipment, so attendees may want to bring an exercise mat and a water bottle. Participants can also use the hashtag #seaportsweat and follow @seaportbos to post their progress, document their efforts, and engage in the Seaport Sweat community.
